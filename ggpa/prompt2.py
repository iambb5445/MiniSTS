f'''In this game, the player have a deck of cards. The game is played in a number of turns.
Every turn, in this exact order:
- Your mana is set to {game_state.max_mana}.
- You draw a set of {game_state.draw_count} cards from your <DRAW_PILE> into your <HAND>. If your <DRAW_PILE> doesn't have enough cards, you draw as much as you can, then you shuffle all the cards from your <DISCARD_PILE> into your <DRAW_PILE>. Then, you draw the remaing number of cards from your <DRAW_PILE> into your <HAND>.
- You play as many cards as you want as long as you have enough <MANA> to play them. Then you end your turn.
- When you end your turn, all the remainig cards in your <HAND> move to your <DISCARD_PILE>. You will draw new cards next turn.
- When you end your turn, Your enemies one by one do their intended action (this is shown for each enemy as "intention"). Note that the intention of an enemy will be affected by its status effects. For example, if an enemy intends to attack for 3, but has 4 <STRENGTH>s, it will deal 7 damage.
When any creature gets attacked, first it loses <BLOCK>. Whatever damage is left, it loses as <HP>. Any block lasts only for one turn.
Any creature that reaches an <HP> of zero or less, is removed from the game.
The <STATUS_EFFECTS> in the game are defined as follows:
Every <STATUS_EFFECT> has a value x. The value of a <STATUS_EFFECT> can stack, meaning that if applied multiple times on the same target, their x values are added together.
- <VULNERABLE>: Take 50% more damage from attacks for x turns.
- <WEAK>: Deal 25% less attack damage for x turns.
- <STRENGTH>: Deal x more attack damage. It affects multi-attacks multiple times.
- <VIGOR>: Deal x more attack damage only on the next attack card you play (this turn or after). It affects multi-attacks multiple times.
- <BOMB>: Deal 40 damage to all enemies after x turns.
- <TOLERANCE>: Gain X block at the end of your turn. Increase X by 1.
If your character is removed from the game, you lose the game.
If all the enemies are removed from the game, you win the game.
Your goal is to win the game with as much remaining health as possible.
To "Exhaust" a card means that the cards will move to your <EXHAUST_PILE> and will not be playable for the rest of the game.
You started with the following cards in your deck:
{nl.join([f'{count} of card <name: {card.name}, mana cost:{card.mana_cost.peek()}, type:{card.card_type}{nl}' +
          f'description: {card.get_description()}>' for card, count in deck.values()])}'''

f'''Right now, the game is in turn {battle_state.turn}, and it's time for you to play.
You have {battle_state.mana} <MANA> out of the {game_state.max_mana} <MANA> that you get every turn.
You have:
hp:{player.health}/{player.max_health}, block:{player.block}, status effects:{repr(player.status_effect_state)}
Your enemies are:

You have the following cards in your <EXHAUST_PILE>:
{'-empty-' if len(battle_state.exhaust_pile) == 0 else
  ' '.join([f'{i}: {card.get_name()}' for i, card in enumerate(battle_state.exhaust_pile)])}
You have the following cards in your <DISCARD_PILE>:
{'-empty-' if len(battle_state.discard_pile) == 0 else
 ' '.join([f'{i}: {card.get_name()}' for i, card in enumerate(battle_state.discard_pile)])}
You have the following cards in your <DRAW_PILE>, but in an unknown order:
{'-empty-' if len(battle_state.draw_pile) == 0 else
 ' '.join([f'{i}: {card.get_name()}' for i, card in enumerate(battle_state.draw_pile)])}
You have the following cards in your <HAND>:
{'-empty-' if len(battle_state.hand) == 0 else
 ' '.join([f'{i}: {card.get_name()}' for i, card in enumerate(battle_state.hand)])}
This turn, you can do one of the following (your <OPIONS>):

Let's think about the possible strategies based on your deck. Considering the cost and effect of your card, let's find which cards are better to use in general, or if there are any synergies between your cards.
A synergy between a set of cards is when the cards are better when they are used together. Of course, we don't want to use two cards just because they affect each other, but we want to see if there are any specifically powerful card/cards that we can use.
In the first paragraph, list up to 3 strategies for the rest of the game based on your deck.
In the second paragraph, rank these synergies. Write which one of these strategies you want to use now based on the avaialble cards, resources, and overal state of the game.
In the third paragraph, tell us what would be your move between the provided <OPTIONS> based on your target strategy.
